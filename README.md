Nice to see you here!

My name is Yulia. I am a Computer Programming Diploma graduate at Humber College.

I've had a chance to work with different aspects of IT, and have concluded that my interests lay in React, ReactNative, Python, PL/SQL, and Java.

I've currently build two sites from scratch on React and made them live. Check out http://www.fixiths.ca and https://trana-solutions.com.
