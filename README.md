Nice to see you here!

My name is Yulia. I am a computer programming student at Humber College, completing my last year of Computer Programming Diploma.

I've had a chance to work with different aspects of IT, and have concluded that my interests lay in React, ReactNative, SQL, and Java.

In my personal time I'm currently working on two projects, a React Native app and a React website that generates dishes to cook, take a look at my code in my repositories! (RandomDishGenerator)
