Nice to see you here!

My name is Yulia. I am a Computer Programming Diploma graduate at Humber College.

I've had a chance to work with different aspects of IT, and have concluded that my interests lay in React, ReactNative, Python, PL/SQL, and Java.

In my personal time I'm currently working on two projects, a React Native app and a React website that generates dishes to cook, take a look at my code in my repositories! (RandomDishGenerator)
