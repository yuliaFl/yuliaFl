Nice to see you here!

My name is Yulia. I am a Computer Programming Diploma graduate at Humber College.

I've had a chance to work with different aspects of IT, and have concluded that my interests lay in React, ReactNative, Python, PL/SQL, and Java.

In my personal time I'm currently working on a project for a handyman using React http://www.fixiths.ca, and completeing two courses on Udemy.
